This project quantifies the value of an NBA player on a rookie contract by creating a model
predicting veteran salary and using that to predict the true market value for players on a rookie
contract. From there, a team surplus is calculated by subtracting the actual salary of a player from
their market value. I found that nearly all players on a rookie contract have a positive team surplus,
meaning that their on-court performance is better than their salary would indicate. I created a
second model that predicts team surplus from overall draft pick and years of experience. This
model found that, as draft pick increases, team surplus increases indicating that the most valuable
draft picks are at the end of the first round. The R script and final essay are included in the project.
